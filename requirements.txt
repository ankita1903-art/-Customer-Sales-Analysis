1. Functional Requirements:
The system must read sales data from a CSV file.
The system must clean the dataset by removing missing and duplicate records.
The system must calculate total sales revenue and total quantity sold.
The system must analyze sales performance by region, monthly income, top customer, etc. 
The system must export formatted analysis results and insights into CSV files.

2. Non-Functional Requirements:
The program should be easy to understand and maintain.
The analysis should be completed within a reasonable execution time.
The output CSV files should be well-structured and readable.
The system should be platform-independent.
The solution should use standard and reliable libraries.

3. Software Requirements:
Operating System: Windows
Programming Language: Python 3.14
Libraries:
Pandas (for data analysis)
Matplotlib
Development Tools:
Jupyter Notebook 

3. Data Understanding Requirements:
Ability to understand the dataset structure (rows, columns, data types)
Knowledge of what each variable represents (categorical vs numerical)

4. Data Preprocessing Requirements:
Handling missing or null values
Detecting and treating outliers
Encoding categorical variables (label encoding, one-hot encoding)
Data normalization or standardization if required.

7. User Requirements:
Programming Knowledge
	Python or R fundamentals
	Data handling libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
	Statistical libraries (SciPy, StatsModels)
	Data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

8. Data Analysis Skills:
Data cleaning and transformation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature understanding and selection

9. Domain Knowledge
Understanding the domain of the dataset (e.g., customer churn, finance, healthcare)
Ability to connect statistical results to real-world meaning

8. Constraints
The project analyzes only the provided dataset.
Insights depend on the accuracy of the input data.
Visualization depends on the given data and how the user select the form of the chart.
